Jersey OAuth 1 signature extension for SSH keys
===============================================

With this extension to Jersey OAuth 1, one can use her SSH RSA keys to sign and verify her requests

The current implementation is only tested with [Jersey 1.16] (https://jersey.java.net/documentation/1.16/index.html) because that's the version I'm using.
